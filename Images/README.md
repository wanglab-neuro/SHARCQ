This 'Images' folder should contain TIFF (.tif,.tiff) files that are either 1 channel or 3 (RGB) channels of 
mouse brain histology sections with labeled neurons. The file names of the images should be identical to their
corresponding ROI coordinate files (.csv). 

Download the example images and place them in this folder to practice running the program.
