This 'ROI Coordinates' folder should contain .csv files that have been generated through manual or automatic
cell counting of fluorescently labeled histology images. These file names should be identical to corresponding
image files. 

Download the example .csv files from the requirements section of the github Wiki and place them in this folder 
to practice running the program.
